:jbake-summary: This is so meta, but for my first blog post I wanted to start this blog by writing about the way it was created.



== Intro

{jbake-summary}
You can find the repository of this blog here:

https://github.com/atrifyllis/trifiblog[Trifiblog repository]

== Prerequisites

* Basic familiarity with Maven
* A GitHub account

== Some Initial Requirements

The main requirements for this project was a fast and easy way to:

* write blog posts
* generate a static site from the posts
* publish the blog online

Subjectively, the easiest way to write technical documentation is https://asciidoctor.org/[Asciidoc(tor)], so we decided that writing the blog posts in Asciidoc was a no-brainer.

I started looking at https://jbake.org/[JBake] for the static site generator. Especially if you are familiar with the whole Java ecosystem it makes sense to stick with it.

Finally, publishing a site that resides in a GitHub repository through https://pages.github.com/[GitHub Pages] is really straight-forward. There is not even any need for CI builds (if you don't want to), whatever is inside the `/docs` folder of the repository is getting published!

== Uber Fails

NOTE: If you don't want to read about the initial failures, you can skip directly to <<_maven_to_the_rescue,the solution that worked for me>>

=== JBake "native"

The first roadblock we hit was when we tried to use JBake directly in a Windows laptop. It seems relevant to this issue:

https://github.com/jbake-org/jbake/issues/655

Setting the  destination folder of the JBake generated site was a hard requirement, since we needed it to be the `/docs` folder of the repository.

=== Gradle Plugin

Next attempt was the https://github.com/jbake-org/jbake-gradle-plugin[Gradle plugin] for JBake. This is where we hit the second roadblock. There were several kinds of exceptions.

For example, when trying to run the `bakePreview` Gradle task I was getting the following exception:

----
Cannot set readonly property: level for class: org.gradle.internal.logging.services.DefaultLoggingManager
----

== Maven to the rescue!

The final and successful attempt was to use the https://github.com/jbake-org/jbake-Maven-plugin[JBake Maven plugin].

These are the steps that worked for me:

=== 1. Create a new Maven project

For example in IntelliJ this can be done from the new project wizard.

=== 2. Add the JBake Maven build configuration

Add in the pom.xml file the following build configuration:

[source,xml]
----
 <build>
        <plugins>
            <plugin>
                <groupId>org.jbake</groupId>
                <artifactId>jbake-Maven-plugin</artifactId>
                <version>0.3.5</version> <!--1-->
                <configuration>
                    <outputDirectory>./docs</outputDirectory> <!--2-->
                </configuration>
                <executions>
                    <execution>
                        <id>default-generate</id>
                        <phase>generate-resources</phase>
                        <goals>
                            <goal>generate</goal>
                        </goals>
                    </execution>
                </executions>
                <dependencies>
                    <!-- include required dependencies here, see below -->
                    <dependency>
                        <groupId>org.asciidoctor</groupId> <!--3-->
                        <artifactId>asciidoctorj</artifactId>
                        <version>2.4.3</version>
                    </dependency>
                    <dependency>
                        <groupId>org.freemarker</groupId> <!--4-->
                        <artifactId>freemarker</artifactId>
                        <version>2.3.31</version>
                    </dependency>
                    <dependency>
                        <groupId>com.sparkjava</groupId> <!--5-->
                        <artifactId>spark-core</artifactId>
                        <version>2.9.3</version>
                    </dependency>
                </dependencies>
            </plugin>
        </plugins>
    </build>
----
<1> Use the latest version of JBake Maven plugin.
<2> The output folder must be the one that is published from GitHub Pages(`/docs`).
<3> Add asciidoctor Maven dependency since we want to write the blog posts in asciidoc.
<4> Add the templating engine of our choice (in this case using the https://jbake.org/docs/2.6.7/#initialisation_command[default] which is freemarker)
<5> Add latest spark-core dependency to avoid an issue with the jbake:inline goal. More about this issue <<_jbake_watch_issue, later>>.

=== 3. Generate initial site structure

The Maven plugin provides a goal that seeds the project/site with example content and templates. This is a good starting point. Run the following in a CLI window:

----
mvn jbake:seed
----

This will create an initial structure inside `src/main/jbake` folder where the site will be generated from. The structure looks similar to this (click image for actual size):

image::{jbake-structure-image}[Structure,100,100,link={jbake-structure-image},align=center,window="_blank"]

The blog posts and pages that we create will reside inside `content/blog` directory.

=== 4. Serve site locally

The Maven plugin provides a goal to serve the site locally. This goal will watch for any changes and will also re-generate the site (in `/docs` folder). This way we can 1) see the changes in the browser immediately, 2) push the `/docs` folder in GitHub to publish the site automatically (more on that later).

Run the following command from a CLI window:

----
mvn jbake:inline
----

Check the output for a similar line:

----
[INFO] Started ServerConnector@47cdf91a{HTTP/1.1, (http/1.1)}{127.0.0.1:8820}
----

This means that in our local environment the site is accessible under the port 8802 and if we navigate to `http://localhost:8820` we can see the sample blog content as generated by JBake.

=== 5. Publish to GitHub Pages

We can of course delete all sample posts (maybe replacing the about page with our own). When we are ready to publish we need to link the local project with a GitHub repository.

In Intellij go to menu Git  > GitHub > Share Project on GitHub. This implies that we have a GitHub account, and we have linked it with Intellij previously (out of scope for this article).

This how the GitHub repository should look like:

image::{jbake-github-structure}[GitHub,width=50%]

Now we navigate to GitHub repository Settings > Pages.

First, we have to make the repository public if is not already.

Next, we select in the Source section the `master` branch and the `/docs` folder.

For our repository this is how the Pages page looks like:

image::{jbake-github-pages}[width=50%]

If we save these changes, after a small delay we are able to browse our blog under:
`<username>.github.com/<repository_name>`.

.Congratulations!

That is all! We now have our own blog published!

== Extras

=== Custom domain

If we have a domain name or planning to buy one, there are some more steps involved to link the GitHub pages with our domain.

Most of the work involved has to be done in whatever domain provider we are using, so it is out of scope for this article.

Nevertheless, this is what was needed for this particular case:

. Add the domain name in Pages settings without a subdomain (for example `trifiblog.com` not `www.trifiblog.com`). This will create a new commit in our repository with a CNAME file with the following content:
+
----
trifiblog.com
----

. We navigate to the domain name provider web interface and try to find a way to change the DNS settings. In our case, we needed to add the following entries:
+
image::{jbake-github-dns-entries}[]

The first four highlighted entries are `A` records that point to the IP addresses for GitHub Pages.

The other highlighted entry is a `CNAME` record that points the `www.trifiblog.com` to the apex domain `trifiblog.com`

WARNING: This last entry, take it with a grain of salt. This is *not* the way that GitHub recommends to set up apex and www domains together, so it is better to follow the official docs.

For mor information about custom domains and GitHub pages please check the https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site[official GitHub documentation]

=== JBake watch issue

The JBake Maven plugin provides a Maven goal `jbake:inline` for the first time, which bakes (= generates the site), watches and serves out content locally. WhenI tried running it for the first time, and tried changing a post to test the watch mode we got the following exception:

----
...
java.io.FileNotFoundException: C:\dev\WORSKPACE\JBAKE\triblog-Maven\docs\js\bootstrap.min.js (The requested operation cannot be performed on a file with a user-mapped section open)
at java.io.FileOutputStream.open0 (Native Method)
at java.io.FileOutputStream.open (
...
----

https://github.com/jbake-org/jbake/issues/466#issuecomment-476161490[This] reply on the JBake GitHub issues helped me understand that the issue was the outdated spark-core dependency, which depends on an older Jetty version. So adding an explicit dependency to the latest spark-core (seems to) have solved the problem.
